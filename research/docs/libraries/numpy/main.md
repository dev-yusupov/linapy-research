## Purpose of research

To analyze the computational performance and numerical stability of Numpy's linear algebra operations. The research will focus on the following aspects:

1. **Investigate performance bottlenecks** in key linear algebra operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, eigenvalue decomposition) as matrix sizes increase, and how Numpy scales with larger datasets.
2. **Examine the numerical stability** of Numpy in linear algebra operations, particularly in the context of ill-conditioned matrices. to identify any issues related to precision errors or instability during operations such as matrix inversion or eigenvalue computations.

## Objective

To **analyze the computational performance and numerical stability** of Numpy's linear algebra operations, with a particular focus on identifying bottlenecks and potential issues with precision, especially in scenarios involving large datasets or ill-conditioned matrices.

This research aims to explore how well NumPy handles linear algebra operations in terms of speed, memory usage, and numerical accuracy, and to identify areas where it might fall short, such as performance degradation in large-scale computations or precision errors in complex matrix operations.

## Key focus areas

1. **Performance bottlenecks**
    - **Matrix multiplication** - Investigate the performance of Numpy's matrix multiplication function (`numpy.dot` or `@` operator) for large matrices. Measure execution time and memory usage for different matrix sizes.
    - **Matrix inversion** - Analyze the performance of Numpy's matrix inversion function (`numpy.linalg.inv`) for large matrices. Measure execution time and memory usage for different matrix sizes.
    - **Solving linear systems** - Evaluate the performance of Numpy's linear system solver (`numpy.linalg.solve`) for large matrices. Measure execution time and memory usage for different matrix sizes.

2. **Numerical stability**
    - **Conditioning of matrices** - Generate ill-conditioned matrices (e.g., using `numpy.random.rand` or `numpy.random.randn`) and analyze the numerical stability of Numpy's linear algebra operations on these matrices.
    - **Floating-point precision** - Investigate how Numpy handles floating-point precision in linear algebra operations, particularly in the context of ill-conditioned matrices. Measure the impact of precision errors on the results of matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition, and other operations.
    - **Edge cases** - Perform experiments on edge cases where matrices are singular (non-invertible) or nearly singular and examine how NumPy handles these situations, focusing on its ability to detect and handle such cases correctly.

3. **Memory usage and efficiency**

    - **Memory profiling** - Use memory profiling tools (e.g., `cProfile`, `memory_profiler`) to analyze the memory usage of Numpy's linear algebra operations for different matrix sizes. Identify any potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption during computations.
    - **Efficiency in multi-core environment** - Investigate how Numpy's linear algebra operations perform in a multi-core environment. Measure the impact of parallelization on performance and memory usage for large matrices.

4. **Scalibility**
    - **Scaling with larger datasets** - Analyze how Numpy's linear algebra operations scale with larger datasets. Measure the performance and memory usage of operations on matrices of increasing size, and identify any performance degradation or bottlenecks as matrix sizes increase.

## Research methodology

1. **Literature review** - Review existing literature on Numpy's linear algebra operations, focusing on performance and numerical stability. Identify any known issues or limitations in the current implementation.
2. **Experimental setup** - Set up a controlled environment for conducting experiments, including the necessary libraries and tools for performance measurement and memory profiling.
3. **Data generation** - Generate synthetic datasets for testing, including large matrices and ill-conditioned matrices. Use random number generators to create matrices of varying sizes and conditions.
4. **Performance measurement** - Measure the execution time and memory usage of Numpy's linear algebra operations for different matrix sizes and conditions. Use appropriate profiling tools to capture performance metrics.
5. **Numerical stability analysis** - Analyze the results of linear algebra operations on ill-conditioned matrices, focusing on precision errors and stability. Compare results with expected outcomes and identify any discrepancies.
6. **Data analysis and Documentation** - Analyze the collected data, identify patterns and trends, and document the findings. Prepare a report summarizing the research results, including performance metrics, numerical stability analysis, and recommendations for improving Numpy's linear algebra operations.
